GraphGL
=======

A network visualization library
-------------------------------


GraphGL is a network visualization library designed for rendering (<i>massive</i>) graphs in web browsers and puts dynamic graph exploration on the web another step forward. In short, it calculates the layout of the graph in real time and is therefore suitable for static files (exported GraphML/GEXF files) and for dynamic files (LinkedIns InMap would be one such example).

### Usage ###


#### To retrieve the project and required libraries #####

1. git clone git@github.com:uskudnik/GraphGL.git
2. In project directory: git submodule update --init 
3. Wait for download of three.js

After you have retrieved the library, you can start playing with it.

At the moment static graphs are only available from particlesystem branch. 

Library expects JSON data for input in the form of
{"nodes": {
        "nodeid": nodedata, 
        "nodeid": nodedata, ...
    },
 "edges": [
        {"source": "sourceid", "target": "targetid"},
        {"source": "sourceid", "target": "targetid"}, ...
    ]
}

In the case of static graph (that is, graph that does not need to layout calculated), nodedata must include size, coordinates and color of a node.

An example:

{"label": "text",
 "size": 3.57,
 "x": 339.43,
 "y": 246.62,
 "r": 175,
 "g": 182,
 "b": 75
}

As for dynamic dataset, you can provide whatever you like for nodedata, from examples:

{"nodes": {
    "344": "java.awt.MenuBar",
    "345": "java.awt.peer.FramePeer", ... },
 "edges": [...]
}
